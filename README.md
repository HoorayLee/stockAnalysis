# stockAnalysis
This is a testing stock price analyzer. Instead of using the mathmatical method to predict the trends.
This project will try to take use of the articles, blogs and some other information source to predict thepublic emotion towards a certain company.

WebCrawler, Hadoop, AWS machine learning and a correction model will be applied to it.
